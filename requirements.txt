Core Dependencies
Python 3.x: Required to run the main application and build scripts​
FreeType: Used for rendering TTF fonts and extracting glyph bitmaps during conversion​
PyInstaller: Needed to package the Python application into a standalone Windows executable​
Inno Setup Compiler (ISCC.exe): Required to generate the Windows installer executable from the .iss script​

LVGL-Specific Requirements
LVGL Font Converter Tools: The project relies on LVGL's font conversion methodology, which can be done through the online converter or the Node.js-based lv_font_conv tool​
Node.js v14+: Required if using the lv_font_conv command-line tool for font conversion​
LVGL Library: The generated .c files are designed to be compatible with LVGL's font system for embedded displays​

Development and Build Tools
Python GUI Libraries: The application uses Python's GUI framework (likely Tkinter or similar) for the graphical interface​
Build Automation Script: The build_and_installer.py script automates the build process, requiring proper configuration of paths and dependencies​
Icon File (.ico): Required for customizing the application icon during the PyInstaller build process​
